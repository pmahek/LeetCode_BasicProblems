## 1. Two Sum

**Problem:**  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find indices of two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Key Idea:**  
Use a dictionary (hash map) to store numbers and their indices for an efficient O(n) solution.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
